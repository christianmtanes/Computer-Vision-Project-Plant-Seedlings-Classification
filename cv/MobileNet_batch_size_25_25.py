First is sequential this means we’re going to have a model that’s a sequence

we set up a sequential model that we can add layers to

first we add all of pre-trained  model
we've written include_top=False, this is how specify that we want to exlude
the layer that makes prediction into the thousands of categories used in the ImageNet competition
we set the weights to be 'ImageNet' to specify that we use the pre-traind model on ImageNet
pooling equals average says that if we had extra channels in our tensor at the end of this step
we want to collapse them to 1d tensor by taking an average across channels
now we have a pre-trained model that creates the layer before the last layer
that we saw in the slides

we add a dense layer to make predictions,
we specify the number of nodes in this layer which in this case is
the number of classes,
then we want to apply the softmax function to turn it into probabilities

we tell tensor flow not to train the first layer which is the  pre-trained model

the compile command tells tensorflow how to update the relationships in the dense connections 
when we're doing the training with our data, we have a measure of loss or inaccuracy we want 
to minimize we specify as categorical cross entropy (log loss function) 
we use The Adam optimization algorithm which is an extension to stochastic gradient descent to
minimize the categorical cross entropy, we ask it to report the accuracy metric
that is what fraction of predictions were correct this is easier to interpret than categorical cross entropy scores,
so it would prints out how the model is doing

we create the generator object in the abstract

function every time it reads an image, we use this function to be consistent with how
the pre-trained model is created

we use the flow from directory command, we tell it what directory the data is in, 
target_size = what size image we want,
batch size = how many images to read in at a time,

the ImageDataGenerator is especially valuable when working with
large data sets because we don't need to hold the whole data set
in memory at once

now we fit the model
we tell it the training data comes from train_generator
we are set to read 25 images at a time we have 3800 images

the validation data comes from validation generator
the validation generator reads 25 image at a time and we
have 950 images so the validation steps is 38
